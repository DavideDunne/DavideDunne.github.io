# [IoT Medical Sensor Project](https://github.com/DavideDunne/HEMS)

This project is an IoT-based solution developed to monitor and report medical data. It was designed with the aim to streamline the process of health monitoring and data management.

## Key Technologies

- **ESP32 Board:** The core of the project is the ESP32 board, a powerful and versatile microcontroller that is ideal for IoT projects. It was used to interface with various medical sensors and manage the data collection process.

- **PlatformIO:** The project was developed using PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem for IoT development. PlatformIO's comprehensive toolset and support for ESP32 made it an excellent choice for this project.

- **Medical Sensors:** The project utilizes a variety of medical sensors to collect health data. The use of multiple sensors allows for a more comprehensive and accurate health monitoring system.

- **Highcharts:** The data collected by the sensors is reported using Highcharts, a JavaScript charting library. Highcharts was used to create interactive and visually appealing charts, enhancing the user experience and making the data easier to understand.
