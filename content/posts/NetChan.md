# [Netchan: A .NET Imageboard](https://github.com/DavideDunne/NetChan)

This project, named "Netchan", is an imageboard developed using .NET, Entity Framework, and Blazor. It was designed with the aim to provide a platform for users to share and discuss images.

## Key Technologies

- **.NET:** The backbone of the project is .NET, a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. It was used to manage the overall structure and functionality of the application.

- **Entity Framework:** The project uses Entity Framework, an open-source object-database mapper for .NET. It was used to manage the application's data access, providing an efficient and developer-friendly way to interact with the database.

- **Blazor:** The user interface of the application was developed using Blazor, a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET. Blazor's ability to run in the browser with WebAssembly made it an excellent choice for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
