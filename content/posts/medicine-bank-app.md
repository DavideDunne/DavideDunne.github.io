# [Medicine Bank Application for NGO](https://github.com/SantiagoVeraEspinoza/Banco_de_Medicamentos_App)
This project is a mobile application developed for iOS, specifically designed to serve as a Medicine Bank for a non-profit organization. It was developed as part of a school project, with the aim to streamline the process of medicine distribution and management.

## Key Technologies
Swift: The application is built using Swift, a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS. Swift's clear syntax and developer-friendly features made it an ideal choice for this project.

Apple Maps: One of the key features of the application is its integration with Apple Maps. This allows users to easily locate the NGO's medicine distribution centers, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

Google Firebase: The application also utilizes Google Firebase for its backend. Firebase provides a comprehensive suite of features including a real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage. This not only facilitated a smooth development process but also ensures the application's scalability and reliability.
