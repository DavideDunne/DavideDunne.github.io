<p>This project is an IoT-based solution developed to monitor and report medical data. It was designed with the aim to streamline the process of health monitoring and data management.</p>
<h2 id="key-technologies">Key Technologies</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ESP32 Board:</strong> The core of the project is the ESP32 board, a powerful and versatile microcontroller that is ideal for IoT projects. It was used to interface with various medical sensors and manage the data collection process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PlatformIO:</strong> The project was developed using PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem for IoT development. PlatformIO&rsquo;s comprehensive toolset and support for ESP32 made it an excellent choice for this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medical Sensors:</strong> The project utilizes a variety of medical sensors to collect health data. The use of multiple sensors allows for a more comprehensive and accurate health monitoring system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highcharts:</strong> The data collected by the sensors is reported using Highcharts, a JavaScript charting library. Highcharts was used to create interactive and visually appealing charts, enhancing the user experience and making the data easier to understand.</p>
