<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>.NET:</strong> The backbone of the project is .NET, a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. It was used to manage the overall structure and functionality of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entity Framework:</strong> The project uses Entity Framework, an open-source object-database mapper for .NET. It was used to manage the application&rsquo;s data access, providing an efficient and developer-friendly way to interact with the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blazor:</strong> The user interface of the application was developed using Blazor, a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET. Blazor&rsquo;s ability to run in the browser with WebAssembly made it an excellent choice for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.</p>
